# **Convex Hackathon: Mapping Needs and Resources in the Gaza Strip**

### **Overview**
This project, developed for the **Convex Hackathon**, leverages the power of the Convex backend framework and the `react-leaflet` library to dynamically map and manage resources in the Gaza Strip. By integrating real-time data with geographical mapping, it aims to facilitate timely assistance to people in need, connecting them with available resources in their area.

### **Key Features**
- **End-to-End Type Safety**: Built on **Convex**, the project ensures type safety from backend to frontend, enhancing code reliability and reducing potential bugs across the entire stack.
  
- **Real-Time Data Updates**: Convex's powerful real-time data synchronization capabilities make it perfect for managing a dynamic system where people's needs and the availability of resources are constantly changing. Data is updated in real time, allowing users to view the most current information about available assistance and nearby resources.

- **Geographical Mapping with React-Leaflet**: The integration with `react-leaflet` enables users to visually map out areas of need and resource availability. Users can view real-time changes on the map, ensuring they stay informed about the most recent updates regarding assistance in their location.

### **Use Case**
The Gaza Strip, with its ongoing humanitarian challenges, often requires real-time coordination of resources like medical supplies, food, and shelter. This project provides a platform for visualizing current needs alongside the availability of potential aid. By mapping resources and needs, local residents or aid workers can quickly identify where help is required and how best to allocate resources efficiently.

### **How it Works**
1. **Frontend with React and React-Leaflet**: The user interface is built using React, with `react-leaflet` for displaying real-time data on the map. The map shows resource locations, and users can see updated markers that represent available assistance.

2. **Backend with Convex**: Convex is used to manage the backend, providing seamless, end-to-end type safety and enabling real-time updates between the server and the client. Convex’s real-time functionality ensures that changes in resource availability or needs are instantly reflected on the map.

3. **Real-Time Sync**: Users can add needs or resources to the map, which are immediately reflected to others in the network, providing a constantly updated view of the situation on the ground.

### **Conclusion**
This project takes advantage of **Convex's real-time, type-safe backend** and **React-Leaflet's intuitive mapping capabilities** to create a system that visually tracks critical resources in the Gaza Strip. By providing a platform for real-time collaboration, it aims to make the process of identifying needs and delivering aid faster and more efficient.

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React, React-Leaflet
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time data management and type-safe API)
- **Mapping**: Leaflet via `react-leaflet`

This project demonstrates how Convex’s real-time data sync and robust type safety can support impactful, real-world applications like resource allocation in humanitarian crises.
